The original data is transformed by:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

'x_train', 'x_test', 'y_train', 'y_test', 'subject_train' and 'subject_test' contain data from the downloaded files.
'features' contains the correct names of the data sets.
'activity_labels' shows the relationship of activity id and the activity types, and the activity types are descriptive to be the names instead of id.
